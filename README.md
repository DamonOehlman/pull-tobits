# pull-tobits

This is a suite of [pull-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream)
throughs that are used to manipulate an incoming buffer into component
parts. In a very simple case it could be used to split a file on 
newline characters (`\n`).  In a more complicated case it could be used
to identify separate chunks in a [bzip2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2)
compressed file.

## Reference

### frame

```js
frame(opts)
```

__Under development__

Separate a single input buffer into frames.  The incoming stream will 
be collected until we have identified that a matching header or footer (or
both) have been successfully identified.

The behaviour of this particular through stream depends on the requested
behaviour:

- for a header-only search, once another matching header is
  identified the through stream will pass that frame on.  In the case
  of the header only search, the EOF file considered to match a new header
  also.

- for a footer-only search, once the footer is identified all queued 
  data is passed on as a frame.

- when both a matching header and footer are required, once we have a match
  at both ends that is passed on as a frame.

### split

```
split(delimiter)
```

Split an incoming buffer into separate parts, and throw away the
delimiters. The following is a pretty contrived example, but demonstrates
the idea:

```js
var bits = require('pull-tobits');
var pull = require('pull-stream');
var input = new Buffer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].join('\n'));

console.log(input);
// --> <Buffer 31 0a 32 0a 33 0a 34 0a 35 0a 36>

pull(
  pull.once(input),
  bits.split([0x0A]),  // bits.split('\n') is equivalent
  pull.log()
);

// --> <Buffer 31>
// --> <Buffer 32>
// --> <Buffer 33>
// --> <Buffer 34>
// --> <Buffer 35>
// --> <Buffer 36>
```
